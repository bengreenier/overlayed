Overlayed is a tool that enables streamers to see their overlays atop their desktop. I built it to interact more seamlessly with my viewers. If you want to interact in faster, more interesting ways it may be built for you too. ❤️

## Installation

Currently, This project is in Alpha status. As such, the only way to install is to clone this repository, and [Build it](#core).

## Configuration

> Note: we don't support a configuration editor today, but one is coming! ✨ 

Overlayed uses [electron-settings](https://github.com/nathanbuchar/electron-settings) under the hood, which saves settings to different locations based on your operating system. 

| Windows | Mac | Linux |
| ------- | --- | ----- |
|`%APPDATA%/overlayed/Settings`|`~/Library/Application\ Support/Overlayed/Settings`|`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Overlayed/Settings`|
||| or |
|||`~/.config/Overlayed/Settings`|

Learn more [in the electron-settings FAQ](https://github.com/nathanbuchar/electron-settings/wiki/FAQs#where-is-the-settings-file-saved).

### Screen Layout

Overlayed can be configured to overlay above a portion of your screen, which can be great if you don't share your entire display when streaming.

To configure the screen layout, modify the following settings:

```
{
  "overlayed": {
    "window": {
      "x": 780,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    }
  }
}
```

+ `x` - the left-most side of the overlay region
+ `y` - the top-most side of the overlay region
+ `width` - the total width of the overlay region
+ `height` - the total height of the overlay region

### Built-In Overlays

Overlayed ships with some built-in overlays. These live [in this directory](./src/app/plugin). There are now configurable!  You can find this information below.

### Custom Overlays

Overlayed supports loading custom plugins from your home directory. To add custom overlays, create a folder in your home directory named `.overlayed` and a folder for each plugin inside that parent folder. For example:

```
home/
  .overlayed/
    TestPlugin/
      package.json
      TestPlugin.js
    OtherPlugin/
      package.json
      OtherPlugin.js
```

All plugins, including custom plugins, are now configurable by adding an object to the configuration file containing the plugin config, indexed by the plugin name.
 For instance:
 {
    "clock": {
       "locale": "en-US"
    }
}

## Contributing

This project loves new contributors, but it is maintained as a side project. If you feel you aren't getting traction, please be patient!

### Core

To contribute to the core of the project (namely, this repository) you'll need the following things:

+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
+ [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

Then clone this repository and execute the following commands from the directory in which you cloned into (likely `overlayed`):

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

These will (in order): install dependencies, build the project, start the application. Please note that this project uses [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build files into the `dist/` folder. As such, the `dist/` folder should not be modified by engineers, nor should it be included in PRs.

### Building an Overlay

> A more detailed walkthrough is coming soon! ✨ 

+ Create a new directory `.overlayed` in your [home directory](http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html)
+ Create a new directory under `.overlayed` for your overlay, like `MyOverlay`
+ Run `npm init` or manually create a `package.json` file
+ Ensure `package.json` contains `name`, `version`, and `main`
+ Ensure main points to a `.js` file that has a [default export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export#Using_the_default_export) (or `module.exports.default = YourClass`)
+ Profit! Overlayed will attempt to load your plugin on start

For example:

__TestOverlay.js:__
```
export default class TestOverlay extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>
  }
}
```


__package.json:__
```
{
  "name": "test-overlay",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "TestOverlay.js"
}
```
